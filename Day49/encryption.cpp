Approach :- find n,m which are floor and ceil of lenght of string , if ( m*n < s.length() ) then we add 1 to n , now we bruteforce all the values in 2d character array
            where no of rows is 'n' and no of coloumn is 'm' and fill the matrix with s[k] , k++ , if k>=s.length then we let the cell empty
