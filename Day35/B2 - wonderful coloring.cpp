Approach :- we will find frequency of each elemnt of array and the frequecy of element is >=k then we will color 'k' of those with each of 'k' colors else if 
           frequency is <k then we will create a vector where we will push 'c' times that element in array , at the end we will distribute equal number of elements between
           'k' colors
