Platform :- Codechef
Contest :- Codechef Cook off july 2021
Problem :- Chef in infinite plane
Approach :- We can analyse that for a given value of 'n' we can have atmax (n-1) disting points in 2-d plane so we will maintain a map to store frequecy of each element
            we will increment our answer if frequecy of that element is less than the value of element
