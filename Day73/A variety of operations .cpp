Contest :- Codeforces Deltix round 742 Div(1+2)
Approach :- You just need to analyse that there are 3 cases :- 
            Case 1:- Difference is odd --> not possible 
            Case 2:- Even difference and a = b 
                 ---> Case 2.1 a = 0  then answer is 0 as we don't need to perform any operation
                 ---> Case 2.2 a != 0 then answer is 1
            Case 3: else we need 2 operations
