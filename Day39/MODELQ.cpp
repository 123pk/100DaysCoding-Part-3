Platform :- Codechef
Contest :- Codechef Cook off july 2021
Approach :- We will find the min value of array and count total number of occurence in array , now we will run through array and will check if 'mn'*2>A[i] then we have
            to change all the elements else we have to change 'n-d' elements only
            here   d ---> frequency of minimum element    and mn ---> minimum element of array
