Platform :- Hackerrank
Approach :- Store the vector of index of occurence of each value in array and now itterate through array and check if both  ( A[i] and target- A[i] )are present as they will add
            up to 'target' value then print the index , if both are same then check if they are present in array more than once or not if yes print the first two index in 
            increasing order.
