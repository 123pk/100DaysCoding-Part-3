Approach :- We do basic bfs and for node 'x' let the 'c' be the cost of reach this node , now for all the adjacent nodes to 'x' cost of reaching out them is 'c+6' according
            to problem statement. so we do basic bfs and starting node has cost '0' and for each node 'x' in bfs we add +6 to unvisited adjacent node od 'x'
