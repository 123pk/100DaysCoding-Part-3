Platform :- Codechef
Contest:- June Lunch time 2021
Problem :- False Number (FALSENUM)
Approach :- we can divide into two case 
           case 1:- starting character is '1'
                   in this case we traverse from 1 to n , n = length of string and as soon as we found a character that is not '0' we add '0'
           case 2:- starting character is not '1'
                   here we add '1' before current string
