/*
Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 640 Div 4
Approach :- we need to find permutaion of 'n' such that adjacent element has difference between 2 and 4 inclusive , we can always do so by printing all odd values <=n
            and then 4 2 and rest of even number .
            If 'n'<=3 it is not possible
