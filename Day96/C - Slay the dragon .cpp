Contest :- Codeforces Educational Round 114
Approach :- There are two options for us in each case either we will choose a value where we have 'value'<x else we choose a 'value' >= 'x' , so we do binary search and will
            find the value just greater or equal than 'x' and biggest value >'x' we can use 'binary_search' or "set.lower_bound()" in c++ to do so in "logN" time.
