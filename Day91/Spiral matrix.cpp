/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- basic implementation , there are four cyclic operations you need to make ( go from) 
            1. left to right
            2. top to bottom
            3. right to left
            4. bottom to top
            ans keep pushing the elements , you will also have to maintain four variables which will be your limit for left,right,up and down movement.
