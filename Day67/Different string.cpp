Approach :- As there are 'n' string and all string are of length 'n' , we can exploit this constraint we can have a string ans which stores the 'ith' value opposite of 'ith' character
           of string 'i'. For example let n=4, i = 3 , ith string  = "1010" ,here ith(3rd) character is '1' so we will add '0' to our answer ( opposite ) of ith character.
