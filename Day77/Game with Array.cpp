Platform:- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round #643 Div 2
Approach :- if n==s we cann't find any such value and array ,and if ((s-(n-1))-(n-1)<2) condition is satisfied then also we cannot find any value and we need to print "NO"
            else we print yes and out array is (n-1)number of 1's and one s-(n-1) and we cannot have a subarray with value (s-n)
